<!--
This is an example of the format of a level xml file.

All the numbers are given in terms of tiles.  A tile is defined as one ground square, which
 makes them 32px by 32px at the moment.

The width and height of a ground tile determine how many of them to place in a
row/column. They default to 1x1 if none are provided

All numbers besides ground width/height can be floating point numbers, but world width
and height probably shouldn't, unless you want fractions of a tile at the end of your world.

x and y positions specify the location of the top-left corner of the object.

TODO: 	type should probably be an attribute
		if there's not a consensus behind specifying things in terms of tiles, switch to px.
